```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

Whether you use the app or you use the command line interface, you will have the results as a table. You can always export this as a spreadsheet. In this case we use the test data set from the package:

```{r out.width = '100%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("app_5.png")
```

What's the information the spreadsheet conveys?

* **Label**: name of the sequence.
* **Clade**: According to the model used, the lineage which the sequence has more likelihood or probability of belonging to.
* **Probability**: Each classification comes with a probability value, which is the proportion of trees that assign the informed clade. Results below 0.2 will be flagged as unknown, regardless of the probability threshold
(meaning that the sequences are probably not RSV related).
* **Length**: Number of bases the sequence has. This should be closer to the expected genome length as possible to obtain the best results.
* **Length_QC**:TRUE, if the length meets the criteria, FALSE if not.This parameter controls how much the sequence length can differ from the expected sequence length according to the classification model selected (proportion). The larger the value the more difference in size would be acceptable. This criteria can be changed during setup.
* **N**: The number of ambiguous bases present in a sequence can have a negative impact on the classification result.
* **N_QC**: TRUE, if the number of N meets the criteria, FALSE if not. This parameter controls how many bases of the sequence are allowed to be ambiguous. Sequences with more ambiguous bases will be set as low quality.
      This criteria can be changed during setup.
* **Probability_QC**: TRUE, if the probability meets the criteria, FALSE if not. The probability threshold parameter allows to set the mininum probability value to consider a classification as valid (proportion). Any classification with a lower value will be set as low quality.This criteria can be changed during setup.
