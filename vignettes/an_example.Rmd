I downloaded a fasta file with multiple sequences of RSV virus from (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

## Let's see how ReSVidex runs this dataset:

First I created a new R script and set the folder where the fasta is saved, as the working directory.

```{r out.width = '100%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("example_2.gif")
```

Loaded the ReSVidex library

```
library(resvidex)
```

Loaded the name of the fasta file, in this case "data_set.fasta"

```
file<-"data_set.fasta"
```

Used the classification function from the ReSVidex package and saved it

```
Classification_Print<-Classify(inputFile=file, model=FULL_GENOME)
```

Visualized on the console the dataframe created by the function writing "Classification_print" on the script and running the line (i could instead write the line in the console itself).

```{r out.width = '100%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("example_1.png")
```

Saved the results as a cvs file to open with an excel type program. This file is always saved in the same folder set as working directory.

```
utils::write.csv2(Classification_Print,"Classification_file.csv")
```

```{r out.width = '100%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("example_3.png")
```

As we can see, most of the sequences didn't pass the probability check, and couldn't be classified in our model.
