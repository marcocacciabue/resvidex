I downloaded a fasta file with multiple sequences of RSV virus from (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Using the filters from the page, I selected mostly sequences that passes the ReSVidex longitud filter, but a couple of them won't.

Let's see how ReSVidex runs this dataset:

After creating a new R script and loading the ReSVidex library i load the dataset, using
```
```

```{r setup}
library(resvidex)
```
