	abstract = {Abstract
          A globally implemented unified classification for human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) below the subgroup level remains elusive. Here, we formulate the global consensus of HRSV classification based on the challenges and limitations of our previous proposals and the future of genomic surveillance. From a high-quality dataset of 1,480 HRSV-A and 1,385 HRSV-B genomes submitted to NCBI and GISAID up to March 2023, we categorized HRSV-A/B sequences into lineages based on phylogenetic clades and amino acid markers. We defined 24 lineages within HRSV-A and 16 within HRSV-B, providing guidelines for prospective lineages definition. Our classification demonstrated robustness in its applicability to both complete and partial genomes. In addition, it allowed the observation of notable lineage replacements and the identification of lineages exclusively detected since the COVID-19 pandemic. We envision that this unified HRSV classification proposal will strengthen and facilitate HRSV molecular epidemiology on a global scale.},

Ensembles of classification, regression and survival trees are supported. We describe the implementation, provide examples, validate the package with a reference implementation, and compare runtime and memory usage with other implementations. The new software proves to scale best with the number of features, samples, trees, and features tried for splitting. Finally, we show that ranger is the fastest and most memory efficient implementation of random forests to analyze data on the scale of a genome-wide association study.},

	abstract = {Accurate and fast characterization of the subtype sequences of Avian influenza A virus (AIAV) hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) depends on expanding diagnostic services and is embedded in molecular epidemiological studies. A new approach for classifying the AIAV sequences of the HA and NA genes into subtypes using DNA sequence data and physicochemical properties is proposed. This method simply requires unaligned, full-length, or partial sequences of HA or NA DNA as input. It allows for quick and highly accurate assignments of HA sequences to subtypes H1–H16 and NA sequences to subtypes N1–N9. For feature extraction, k-gram, discrete wavelet transformation, and multivariate mutual information were used, and different classifiers were trained for prediction. Four different classifiers, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K nearest neighbor (KNN), and Decision Tree, were compared using our feature selection method. This comparison is based on the 30\% dataset separated from the original dataset for testing purposes. Among the four classifiers, Decision Tree was the best, and Precision, Recall, F1 score, and Accuracy were 0.9514, 0.9535, 0.9524, and 0.9571, respectively. Decision Tree had considerable improvements over the other three classifiers using our method. Results show that the proposed feature selection method, when trained with a Decision Tree classifier, gives the best results for accurate prediction of the AIAV subtype.},
